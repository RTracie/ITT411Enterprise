# ITT411Enterprise
Final Project Files
I used VS Code to create the files, and Xampp as the server

1. create the database from the datbase file
2. read thru the database file, the usernames and passwords are there in a table
3. If you use Xampp as well, copy the .php files to C:\xampp\htdocs, or wherever your Xampp folder is located on your local disk
4. If you don't use Xampp, then... I don't know lool
5. REMEMBER TO LOAD UP XAMPP AND RUN APACHE!!!
6. copy -> localhost/EnterpriseAssignment/index.php <- into your web browser, that will automatically run the 'index.php' file
7. login with the data from #2, and navigate.
8. if you see updates that can be made, make them! I'm exhausted now!

I'm sorry this is so late, but... blame Otis!!!
