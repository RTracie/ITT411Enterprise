# ITT411Enterprise
Final Project Files

I used VS Code to create the files, and Xampp-Apache as the server

1. create the database from the datbase file
2. read thru the database file first
3. there are 3 logins: admin - admin, registry - registry, admin - 123456
4. If you use Xampp as well, copy the .php files to C:\xampp\htdocs, or wherever your Xampp folder is located on your local disk
5. If you don't use Xampp, then... I don't know lool
6. REMEMBER TO LOAD UP XAMPP AND RUN APACHE!!!
7. copy -> localhost/EnterpriseAssignment/index.php <- into your web browser, that will automatically run the 'index.php' file
8. login with the data from #2, and navigate.
9. if you see updates that can be made, make them! I'm exhausted now!

I'm sorry this is so late, but... blame Otis!!!
